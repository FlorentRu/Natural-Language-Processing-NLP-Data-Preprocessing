# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Data-Preprocessing

Overview:

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Data Preprocessing project aims to streamline the initial stages of NLP projects by providing a set of preprocessing techniques and tools. Data preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP tasks, as it involves cleaning, formatting, and transforming raw text data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to facilitate the preprocessing of text data for NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis.

Features:

Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert text to lowercase to ensure consistency in word representations.
Stopword Removal: Eliminate common stopwords that do not contribute much to the overall meaning of the text.
Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form to normalize variations in word morphology.

Technologies Used
Python: The project is implemented primarily in Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem of NLP libraries such as NLTK

GitHub: The project repository is hosted on GitHub to enable version control, collaboration, and community contributions.
Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided using Markdown format to guide users on installation, usage, and customization of the preprocessing tools.

Usage:
To utilize the preprocessing tools provided by the project, users can clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip. They can then import the preprocessing modules into their Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks and integrate them into their NLP pipelines.
